The data to be used for the GPR imaging algorithm is saved in the file gpr_data.mat

The variables are defined as:

F : the 128x200 data array of FMCW frequency data collected during the experiment (where each column corresponds to the antenna position, and each row corresponds to a frequency value)
f: 128 point frequency vector corresponding to the transmit frequency band used in (Hz)
da: position of the antenna at each data collection point (m)
